# MongoDB forEach Async/Await Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error when using MongoDB's `find().forEach()` with `async/await` within the `try` block and `MongoClient.connect()`.  The problem arises because `forEach`'s asynchronous nature isn't well-handled with async/await in this particular context.  This can lead to premature closing of the database connection and incomplete data retrieval.

## Bug Description:

The `forEach` method doesn't inherently wait for each callback to finish before proceeding. Therefore, if processing each document takes longer than expected or involves other asynchronous calls, the `client.close()` within the `finally` block may execute before all documents are processed.  This results in the connection being closed prematurely and data loss.

## Solution:

The provided solution shows how to correctly use async/await with MongoDB to ensure all data is processed before closing the connection using `toArray`. This approach guarantees all results are collected before the connection is closed.
